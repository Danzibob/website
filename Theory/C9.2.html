<h3>Waterfall Method</h3>
<img src="Images/waterfall.jpg" class="post_image"></img>
<ul style="float:left;width:50%;">
<li><p>The waterfall method of development is a well known and often criticised model.</p></li>
<li><p>It consists of several development stages which are completed in sequence</p></li>
</ul>
<table>
<tr><th>Advantages</th> <th>Disadvantages</th></tr>
<tr><td style="width:50%;padding-left:0px;"><ul>
           <li>Simple</li>
           <li>Easy to manage</li>
           <li>Every section and member of the project has a clear goal from the start</li>
           <li>Can work well with large scale, stable projects (e.g. developing an OS)</li>
</ul></td><td>
           Because of the linear nature of this system, each stage has to be completed perfectly for the next one to run smoothly. For example, if the requirements aren't correctly understood in the first stage of the project, this can mean huge knock on effects later down the line. No-one would know that the product wasn't suitable until the product is returned to the user
</td></tr>

    <div class="post">
<h3>RAD (Rapid Application Development)</h3>
<img src="Images/rad.jpg" class="post_image"></img>
<ul style="float:left;width:50%;">
    <li>RAD relies heavily on prototyping</li>
    <li>A prototype can be anything from a layout design to an almost functioning product</li>
    <li>Each prototype is shown to the user to get their feedback before the next enters development</li>
</ul>
<table>
<tr><th>Advantages</th> <th>Disadvantages</th></tr>
<tr><td style="width:50%;padding-left:0px;"><ul>
           <li>Works well when requirements aren't fully clear from the outset</li>
           <li>Constant client feedback leads to excellent usability</li>
           <li>Client directly influences project direction all the way through</li>
</ul></td><td><ul>
    <li>As the focus is on usability, code often turns out inefficient</li>
    <li>Necessary to be in constant contact with the client</li>
    <li>Doesn't scale well, so is unsuitable for larger projects</li>
</ul></td></tr>
</table>
    </div>

    <div class="post">
<h3>Spiral method</h3>
<img src="Images/spiral.jpg" class="post_image" style="height:350px;"></img>
<ul style="float:left;width:50%;">
    <li>Spiral is heavily focused on risk management</li>
    <li>creates prototypes every cycle, much like RAD</li>
    <li>Each cycle of the spiral is planned before it's carried out</li>
</ul>
<table>
<tr><th>Advantages</th> <th>Disadvantages</th></tr>
<tr><td style="width:50%;padding-left:0px;"><ul>
           <li>Ideal for high risk projects (eg game development)</li>
           <li>Large projects involve many such risks and are perfect for this model</li>
           <li>Risks can be dealt with as soon as they arise, or even before</li>
</ul></td><td><ul>
    <li>Risk analysis is a very specialised skill</li>
    <li>The model is only as good as the risk analysts working on it</li>
    <li>Good analysts are expensive, and increase the cost of a project</li>
</ul></td></tr>
