			<h3>The CPU</h3>
			<p>The CPU is often described as the 'brain' of the computer system. This is rather misleading, but it does carry out all the instructions given to it. Inside a CPU there are billions of transistors (electronic switches), combined into logic gates which can perform arithmetic and logical operations</p>
			<h4>Moore's Law</h4>
			<p>Gordon Moore (founder of Intel) predicted in 1965 that the number of transistors on a CPU would double approximately every 2 years. Since then this has held true.</p>

			<h3>Clock Speed</h3>
			<p>The clock speed of the CPU is the number of cycles per second. Clock speed is measured in Hertz (Hz). Modern CPUs run in the range of Gigahertz (1,000,000,000 or more cycles per second). The greater the clock speed of a CPU, the better it's performance. However, performance can be affected by many other factors.</p>

			<h3>Inside the CPU</h3>
			<p>NB: This model of a CPU is an <em>abstraction</em>; a simplifed version to make it easier to understand. Modern processors are far more complex</p>
			<h4>Program Counter (PC)</h4>
			<p>Keeps track of the memory location of the line of code being executed. Is incremented each cycle. Can also be changed by control flow operations (e.g: BRP, BRZ and BRA in the LMC</p>
			<h4>Memory Data Register (MDR)</h4>
			<p>Stores data that has been fetched from or stored in memory</p>
			<h4>Memory Address Register (MAR)</h4>
			<p>Stores the address of the data or instructions to be fetched from or sent to memory</p>
			<h4>Current Instruction Register (CIR)</h4>
			<p>Stores the most recently fetched instruction, waiting to be decoded and executed</p>
			<h4>Accumulator (ACC)</h4>
			<p>Stores the results of calculations by the ALU</p>
			<h4>General Purpose Registers</h4>
			<p>Memory locations within the CPU which can temporarily store data and instructions instead of shipping them back and forth to the much slower memory locations</p>
			<h4>Buses</h4>
			<p>General channels of communication around the CPU. There are 3 main buses to be aware of:</p>
			<ul><li>Data bus: carries data between the processor and memory</li>
				<li>Address bus: carries the address of the memory location to be written to or read from</li>
				<li>Control bus: carries signals from the control unit</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h4>
			<p>Carries out all calculations and logical decisions</p>
			<h4>Control Unit (CU)</h4>
			<p>Sends out signals to co-ordinate how the processor works.It controls how data moves around the CPU, and also decodes instructions for the CPU to run.</p>
