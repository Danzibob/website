			<h3>Development of the Internet</h3>
			<h4>1960's</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Linking computers together was first done in the 1960's, using circuit switching. Technologically this was nothing new, but the idea was new.</li>
				<li>Circuit switching was impractical as running cables was expensive and changing connections was slow, and signals would have to be boosted.</li>
				<li>DARPA (under the US millitary) worked on connecting a small number of computers accross the US, and at least 3 groups independently came up with systems of connectivity that would evolve into packet switching.</li>
				<li>Packet switching was first demonstrated at NPL in Teddington, England, as way around the vunerability of previous networks that they could very easily be disconnected</li>
				<li>In 1969, the first connections were made to ARPANET, between 4 computers in US universities. These 4 were the start of the modern internet</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>1970's</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>In 1972, E-mail was born and remained the hottest network application for the next 10 years, showing the way forward for the internet as a means of communication</li>
				<li>ARPANET's open architecture allowed connectivity between widely diverse systems, and was a key factor in making the internet useful very quickly</li>
				<li>To allow independence for each connected network, a connecting protocol was developed so that packets were retransmitted in the case of errors, so communication devices (later routers) didnt have to store details of the data that passed through them</li>
				<li>Further refinements were made such as using checksums, and working with various operating systems, and these refinements fromed the standard of TCP/IP</li>
